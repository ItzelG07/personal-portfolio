                <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
                <p><b>PROBLEM:</b>The struggles of miscommunication with clients made me create this app to consider accessibility issues from the view of a nail technician.</p>
                <p><b>GOAL:</b> Users can access service information to determine their compatibility with the nail technician  or quickly schedule an appointment for regular users.</p>

        <section class="steps">
            <h2>01 Understanding the User</h2>
            <p>I conducted user research through primary and secondary research. I created surveys to find customer issues at nail salons that I could find solutions for and implement in my app. I researched direct and indirect competitors to find pain points and accessible elements about the website. I created user personas and problem statements to look into what a typical user may face when navigating through my app.</p>
                <img class="example" src="images/">

                <h2>02 Refining the Design</h2>
                <p>Change colors for buttons based on importance and contrast.
                    <br>
                    Create featured that would improve the user flow such as grouping elements together so the users can have different options when interacting with the app.
                    <br>
                    Have universal icon that represent descriptions so that it can be understood by all audiences.</p>
                <img class="example" src="images/">

                <h2>03 Responsive Design</h2>
                <p>The sitemap for Rubiginosa includes every screen the app can hold. I highlighted one user flow that I designed for. My user flow includes selecting the “No Polish” manicure service. The user can then schedule the appointment for March 7, 2024 and purchase with a credit card.
                    <br>
                    The Mobile and Tablet screen both have the same format for the homepage but the tablet shows more content below the fold. For the computer screen I created a two tile splash page where there is a image on the left and de3scription with CTA button on the right. Having the wto tile method covers most of the screen without loosing picture quality or causing stretched images.</p>
                <img class="example" src="images/">

                <h2>04 Going Forward</h2>
                <p>When creating my app Rubiginosa, I wanted to make an impact with my accessibility consideration. Colors that were chosen for graphics, buttons, and typography is all intentional with keeping visual accessibility designs in mind. Graphic were kept simple to not be distracting from the content. Typography for buttons and descriptions is a sans serif font.
                    <br>
                    Create more user flows that explore the different sections in the Hamburger Menu.
                    <br>
                    Create translation options for the most spoken languages in the area.
                    <br>
                    Create a section for customer review. “Look at Others Wearing it” would show pictures linked to the clients instagram.</p>
